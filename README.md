# Report Scheduler

## Overview
Out of the box, Dynamics 365 does not provide a method to schedule reports.

This solution installs a Report Renderer plugin in your environment which allows you to render any report (standard or custom) to a specified format.  Using this, you can create flows like this:

## Configuration
