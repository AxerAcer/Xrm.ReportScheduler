# Report Renderer

## Overview
Out of the box, Dynamics 365 does not provide a method to schedule reports.  This solution changes that.

Using this solution, you can create flows like this:

_Note: this currently only works for custom reports with no parameters._

## Installation
Please refer to the installation/configuration procedure [here](./docs/INSTALL.md).
